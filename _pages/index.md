# What is flexbox?

CSS 2.1 defined four layout modes
- **Block layout** for laying out documents
- **Inline layout** for laying out text
- **Table layout** for laying out data in a tabular format
- **Positioned layout** for explicit positioning

**Flex layout** is designed for laying out more complex applications.

The main purpose of a flex container is to expand items to fill available free space, and conversely shrink them to prevent overflow. It can also be used to change visual ordering both horizontally and vertically.

## What can it do?
- [Flex Container]({{ site.baseurl }}/flex-container)
- [Flex Items]({{ site.baseurl }}/flex-items)
- [Practical applications]({{ site.baseurl }}/demos)

## Where can I use it?
Flexbox is now [widely supported](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox) by all modern browsers.
